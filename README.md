# Description:
This semester, we want to implement a simple drawing prototype enriched with some 
automatic functionality. The user should be able to interactively add data points to a 
coordinate system, use these data points to create shapes like lines or circles, or load some 
data automatically. In order to guide you through the implementation process, we came up 
with 8 different tasks
